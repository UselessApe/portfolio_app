# portfolioapp

A Flutter project which shows projects and provide the possibilty to share projects. The UI is pretty simple since it only contains cards with a preview of fake data for:

- Name of the project
- Project Year
- Project Image
- Project Description

SIDENOTE: All these projects shown in the application are not real projects and this application was only for training purposes.

You have the option to share your projects thanks to a FAB. If you click a project card you get navigated to a project detail page and of course you have the option to navigate back.
